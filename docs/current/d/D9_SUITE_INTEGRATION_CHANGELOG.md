# D9 Suite Integration — Change Log

## D9.5.1 — Producer 0.10.0

- Added a C11-D Production Request + Personalization tab to the existing `c11c-producer` GUI.
- Kept all current C11-C Producer screens and launchers; no new app/suite.
- Added toolkit-independent D9 helper for D4 request mapping, the existing delivery profile alias resolver, D4.6 planning, and D4.5 exact parity comparison.
- Added evidence output per unique request under `artifacts/tests/c11d_d9/producer_gui/`.
- Added 90-case core matrix, 12-case personalization matrix and four negative checks.
- Updated Producer/Suite current tests, manifests and active docs; C11-C backend fingerprint and schema version unchanged.
- Runtime authority NONE; D4.8 BLOCKED; this increment creates plans only, not media.
- Windows Qt run and actual text-to-media mapping remain pending.
