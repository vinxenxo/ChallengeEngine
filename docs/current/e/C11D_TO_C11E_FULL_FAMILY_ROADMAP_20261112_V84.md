# C11-E E4C V2.2 PIN-ALIGNMENT R1 — CURRENT AUTHORITATIVE STATE (2026-11-13)

**This block supersedes all earlier E4C V2 installer instructions below.** Older V1.7–V2.2 incidents remain historical evidence; do not rerun superseded packages.

## Current roadmap position

- The V2 design/consumer/test contract remains accepted in isolated qualification. Consumer SHA-256 `e5cf97651e546ad86e2a4d46698553038e4161dc97a55da2654f197ed71f623c` (36,678 bytes); unchanged test SHA-256 `62327e32ed4c15b497efb4a93fecc1d484cebff0b79beaa7ced5099905ffb2bf` (12,263 bytes); Python 3.13.14 compilation and the Qt-offscreen suite previously passed 20/20.
- The approved operator decision record is an immutable, content-pinned approval input: `docs/current/e/C11E_E4C_DRILL_COMPOSITION_OPERATOR_DECISION_RECORD_20261112_V2.json`, 2,925 bytes, SHA-256 `bceef9a22c27447ccbef5487339c25626e4cb4c5d32509809b832411655914e8`. The consumer constant `DECISION_SHA` is exactly this value. Do not edit or append execution state to this record. Put mutable execution state in the Authority, Gates, Backlog, Execution Plan, Incident Register and continuity prompts.
- The first reviewed package `ecfe23aca3de0474c717d03b1d719195612d754f8a5cd14b039fa1179cc1b3bf` was defective because its documentation update appended `latest_execution_state` to that pinned decision record, changing its SHA to `5d77eb624b0f14079a41a83776b5f6cbf7883cc55361f407d5cf5b34ea21c242`. This was correctly rejected by the staged consumer before tests or transaction. Do not use or rerun that ZIP.
- Operator installation attempt `C11E_E4C_DRILL_V2_V2_2_20261113T061938Z_c33b887a` failed closed at `STAGING_AND_PYTHON_TESTS`: `approved V2 design/source pin mismatch` for the decision record. Diagnostic: `artifacts/tests/c11e/e4c_v2_installer/C11E_E4C_DRILL_V2_V2_2_20261113T061938Z_c33b887a/INSTALL_FAILURE.json`. Transaction journal was empty (`[]`), rollback errors were empty, and the failure explicitly reports `FAIL_CLOSED_PRE_TRANSACTION_NO_DESTINATION_WRITES`. No replacement/addition destination was written; no C11-C source was changed; no dispatch or release authority was granted.
- The independent Windows path-specific preflight `C11E_E4C_DRILL_V2_V2_2_20261113T061924Z_7c2e5422` passed: path lengths 139/213/256/195 (evidence root/forward backup/rollback backup/max operation temp), Win32 limit 259; forward and rollback `File.Replace` PASS; probe cleanup PASS. It detected the old V2.1 temp sibling as `FOUND_EXPECTED_POSTIMAGE_PRESERVED`; that file was verified against the accepted consumer postimage and deliberately left untouched. Do not delete it.
- Corrective action: restore the decision record byte-for-byte from the approved V2.2 source (`bceef9a22c27447ccbef5487339c25626e4cb4c5d32509809b832411655914e8`), retain the consumer/test/installer payloads unchanged, and keep operational state exclusively in mutable documentation. No functional consumer, test, installer, or source-pin change is authorized by this correction.

## Corrected package and next action

Use **`C11E_E4C_DRILL_VISUAL_COMPOSITION_V2_REQUALIFICATION_V2_2_PIN_ALIGNED_R1_20261113.zip`** and its adjacent `.sha256` sidecar only. Extract to the new directory `C11E_E4C_DRILL_VISUAL_COMPOSITION_V2_REQUALIFICATION_V2_2_PIN_ALIGNED_R1_20261113` in Downloads; never extract over the active checkout. The installer remains `22f097f672fffcc855e0080ed590bffc8fbe6b3142f3ca57bb270ec2f1883414`. Package shape remains one exact consumer replacement + 24 ADD_ONLY additions, 21 source pins, 27 package files, and the unchanged 20-test suite.

The separate path-specific `File.Replace` probe has already passed against the exact V2.2 installer/path strategy. This pin-alignment correction changes only the decision-record payload and documentation/manifest hashes; it does not alter the installer or any destination path. Do not rerun the standalone probe. The installer itself still performs its own staged checks and its built-in forward/rollback `File.Replace` preflight before any transaction write.

1. Verify the new ZIP using its sidecar, extract to the new package directory, and run the V2.2 installer once with `-PackageZip` set to this exact ZIP.
2. Require package inventory 27/27, source pins 21/21, frozen C11-C manifest PASS, PowerShell AST 2/2, 1 REPLACE + 24 ADD_ONLY, Python runtime/PySide6/Qt-offscreen PASS, py_compile 3/3, staged tests 20/20, built-in File.Replace preflight PASS, immediate recheck PASS, and final `PASS_REPLACE_AND_ADD_ONLY_INSTALL`.
3. On any failure, stop and preserve the full `INSTALL_FAILURE.json`, transaction journal and console output. Do not repeat the installer blindly. Since this failure was pre-transaction, no rollback/recovery work is needed.
4. After install success, audit the receipt, journal, 25 destination postimages and 21 unchanged source pins. Only then run the existing-media V2 A/V requalification once.
5. Do not repeat the accepted GUI/CLI smoke, native captures, music generation, E4B Loop22, Binder or pixel qualifications. Reuse the preserved CLI native MP4 and WAV A/B/C.

## E4C gate state and forward roadmap

- V2 isolated consumer/tests: **PASS**.
- V2.2 path-specific forward/rollback `File.Replace`: **PASS**.
- V2.2 Windows installation: **BLOCKED / NOT INSTALLED** by the pinned decision-record mismatch in the superseded ZIP; corrected pin-alignment R1 candidate prepared, Windows execution pending.
- Existing-media A/V V2 requalification: **NOT RUN / PENDING INSTALL PASS**.
- V2 operator visual/audio acceptance: **PENDING**; `tracking/tier-1` remains 0/20 V2 rows.
- After V2 acceptance, run remaining 19 selectors, close E4C at 20/20, then E5 → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 (CH_008/009 held; 99 provisional) → E8 historical C-to-E regression, independent acceptance, immutable freeze and separately authorized promotion.

## Permanent governance

Active checkout `C:\Users\vinxe\Projects\ChallengeEngineV01_STATELESS` is sole source authority. `GIT_CHECKS=SKIPPED`; `COMMITS=OPERATOR_MANAGED`; no pip or shared dependency changes. C11-C 2.19.12 remains sole production authority; frozen manifest SHA-256 `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`. E1 `PREPARE_ONLY`; `family_adapter.status=NOT_CONNECTED_E1`; no C11-C mutation, no production dispatch, `release_authority=NONE`.

# ROADMAP OVERRIDE — first GUI Drill A/V pilot accepted — 2026-11-12


## Authoritative installer correction — V1.8 package-binding failure / V1.9 consolidated recovery (2026-11-12)

The operator's V1.8 run passed the ZIP sidecar and entered the package installer, then failed closed at `OPERATION_PACKAGE_FILE_BINDING_FAIL` for `docs/current/e/C11D_E_BLOCKER_REMEDIATION_REGISTER_20261112_V54.md`. The V1.8 builder renamed physical documentation payloads to the next versioned filenames (for example V55) but failed to regenerate the matching `replacements`/`additions` destination rows; several operation destinations still referenced their predecessor names. The validator correctly rejected the mismatch before the transaction journal or destination writes. This was a package-manifest construction defect, not a Windows runtime issue. Do not rerun V1.8.

V1.9 is a complete rebuilt overlay. Its operation rows are generated directly from the physical payload tree: `payload/replace/<relative>` maps only to `REPLACE <relative>`, and `payload/add/<relative>` maps only to `ADD_ONLY <relative>`. The installer independently enforces that mapping for every operation, verifies one-to-one closure between all payload files and operation rows, rejects duplicate package paths and destination paths, and checks manifest counters against actual arrays. The V1.9 matrix is exactly one existing D-consumer replacement plus 23 add-only destinations (24 mutation operations); package inventory also includes the README and installer. All versioned current-doc and prompt destinations now match their package paths exactly.

V1.9 preserves the V2 consumer, 18 focused tests, requalifier, runner, 21 support pins and 91-pin/CLI source evidence unchanged. The only changes from V1.8 are installer/manifest construction integrity, corrected operation destinations, documentation/prompt version increments, and incident recording. The V1.8 attempt failed before transaction; no checkout destination mutation occurred. V1.9 remains `NOT_YET_INSTALLED` pending its Windows 5.1/Python 3.13/PySide6 preflight and transaction receipt.

The V1.9 installer also reports pre-transaction failures distinctly as `FAIL_CLOSED_PRE_TRANSACTION_NO_DESTINATION_WRITES` with a `%TEMP%` diagnostic, rather than labelling an empty journal as a completed rollback. No Git, pip, shared dependency, GUI/CLI, E1, C11-C, dispatch or release changes are permitted.



## Authoritative update — V1.7 installer incident and V1.8 correction (2026-11-12)

V1.7 failed closed at `DESTINATION_PREFLIGHT` because it misclassified the newly introduced `tests/test_c11e_e4c_drill_visual_composition_consumer.py` as a replacement. The destination was absent in the active checkout. The declared preimage SHA `aedeb5754d94fdbaad134a653f57ca07466c845dcef081c8774668245455a7a0` is actually the historical V9 test stored under `tools/c11d/d9/`, not a preimage at the new `tests/` path. This is a manifest/installer classification defect, not a V2 consumer failure. The failure occurred before evidence-root and transaction-journal initialization; no destination writes or repository mutations occurred. Its generic `FAIL_CLOSED_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` message reflects a zero-entry/no-op rollback.

V1.8 supersedes V1.7 and is the only candidate permitted for installation. Its operation matrix is exactly one hash-guarded replacement (`tools/c11d/d9/c11e_e4c_drill_visual_composition_consumer.py`) plus 22 `ADD_ONLY` destinations, including the new test module. The installer asserts the exact classification, unique operation destinations, and uses manifest-resolved package paths for staged inputs. It rechecks all source pins and all destination states before journaling/writing. Do not rerun V1.7. No source, GUI/CLI, E1 service, executor, C11-C or shared dependency changes are included.

V1.8 install status: `NOT_YET_INSTALLED`. Do not claim V2 Windows qualification from package/static checks. After install PASS, reuse the already accepted CLI native MP4 and WAV A/B/C for the existing-media V2 requalification; no new C11-C capture or music generation. E4C remains open, V2 A/V acceptance pending operator review, matrix not started. C11-C remains sole production authority; E1 PREPARE_ONLY / NOT_CONNECTED_E1; dispatch false; release authority NONE.

E4C has crossed the first true integrated execution milestone: existing Producer GUI → E1 canonical intent/parity → one D-owned executor → unchanged silent C11-C Drill source capture → Qt D composition → FAMILY_MUSIC_V4 A/B/C → FFmpeg/FFprobe A/C mux and bitstream isolation. Operator visual and audio review is PASS. The locale boundary failure is resolved; V1.4 did not require another adapter correction.

Next: CLI-origin A/V smoke through the existing CLI facade; then the remaining 19 selectors of the 20-selector A/V matrix (the accepted GUI `tracking/tier-1` is row 1). E4C closes only after CLI smoke and 20/20 selector evidence.


**Current E4C position (2026-11-12):** the first single-selector GUI A/V qualification is accepted for `visual_drills / tracking / tier-1`. The operator confirmed visual and listening review PASS. Evidence `D99-GUI-6514F1066E79-production.zip` SHA-256 `5fb910dd7515ca1f80f2fa77a0829836613e933ca7106f00852ccd31d797f8e4`; tests/plan bundle `D99-GUI-6514F1066E79-tests.zip` SHA-256 `5c94ad64666548db478a4265a71345efe28c2a346f215e7cdb477f51dc8dde91`; qualification receipt SHA-256 `d8aad7176ed99d8bc0c067cece58272c5ac44045d55d746c768ea72324d459db`; RUNNING receipt SHA-256 `2f9b388b3541548d79c254161290ad73241109349aea1f57c1ac9c10e092ab2a`. The receipt status is `PASS_E4C_DRILL_SINGLE_SELECTOR_A_V_QUALIFICATION`.

**Independent audit:** 91/91 E1 source pins are identical at pre-execution, immediately-pre-render and post-execution; GUI/CLI E1 semantic identity parity PASS; 810/810 frames composed at 30 fps; phases PRE_ROLL/GAME/END_CTA = 90/630/90 frames; GAME editorial fields are populated and D-composed. `FAMILY_MUSIC_V4` `FLOWING_VECTOR` produces 27s, 44.1 kHz stereo PCM16; A/B seed 840001 WAV SHA `e54b960c799102fb104a99ccd7b94c4a41b5b22d54665acda72106b36646f277` is identical, C seed 840002 WAV SHA `5e81b6426f7915c7cad4c658fc24b90cd17c870a4497f45136a53e43b71efd40` differs. Final A and C are 27s, H.264 High 720×1280 yuv420p TV, 30 fps, 810 frames; AAC-LC 48 kHz stereo; both start at 0. Receipt stream hashes prove video A/C identical and audio A/C different; independent extraction also confirms raw H.264 SHA `500fc010b0d39062997d73643643943d03552082d75a2b8db6c55a3bbe5ad150` matches, while AAC elementary stream SHA differs (`23162fb059ca5e215758d6bbd58b6baba0efc9bd13e94d5921fd96726e19cd67` vs `f98747cc8f408521a3d00e7f4d90a066f3adf366de46d6f89bfefb65e26e86cd`).

Native source SHA `d10950bca9358de4ffe8a9f4f24c8c35cdb37e25050775a9220a4d15ffb45338`; silent D-composed intermediate SHA `60fd3155e70691bb7f2e636d20539e5898554669503888ee34bb78402c9589ad`.

Governance: C11-C frozen manifest remains `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`; `c11c_source_mutation=false`; D3 V5 not invoked; source C11-C audio remains disabled via `-NoSound`; renderer invocation is solely the explicitly authorized isolated E4C qualification scope; `production_dispatch=false`; `release_authority=NONE`. E1 stays `PREPARE_ONLY`, `family_adapter.status=NOT_CONNECTED_E1`. Do not turn these isolated test results into production dispatch or release authority.

**Next gates:** (1) CLI-origin A/V smoke through the existing CLI facade with `--execute-drill-av --origin CLI`, using the same shared D executor and a fresh request ID; (2) 20-selector family A/V matrix; count the accepted GUI `tracking/tier-1` pilot as matrix row 1 and do not rerun it for matrix coverage; (3) E4C closeout only after CLI smoke, all remaining 19 selectors, receipts, human review and source-pin integrity. Then E5 → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 (CH_008/009 held; 99 provisional) → E8 historical C-to-E regression, independent acceptance, freeze and separately authorized promotion.

## Superseded prior revision content

E4C's visual/Binder/native-source qualifications remain accepted. The first shared A/V pilot has now exercised the GUI path: E1 preparation, GUI/CLI semantic parity and D composition planning pass; native capture is blocked by the D adapter's locale-sensitive `0.75` → `0,75000` → PowerShell `75000` argument conversion. V1.4 adds an invariant-culture PowerShell bridge and an `es-ES` pre-transaction probe.

The next work remains: (1) install V1.4 and verify all postimages; (2) fresh-ID `tracking/tier-1` A/V pilot; (3) inspect media/receipt and operator visual+audio acceptance; (4) CLI smoke against the same adapter; (5) 20-selector family A/V matrix; (6) close E4C only after the accepted matrix; then E5, E6 Smoke18, E7 Matrix101 and E8 independent regression/freeze/promotion. No roadmap promotion is inferred from a planning receipt.



## D99-GUI-85201B7B4FF7 — single-selector A/V pilot diagnosis — 2026-11-12

**Authoritative evidence:** `D99-GUI-85201B7B4FF7.zip` SHA-256 `0913179f9852b7b1f75c2a7e2f763a111bc8d807d08d20036a2891ae94661f56`; `D99-GUI-85201B7B4FF7-tests.zip` SHA-256 `16f0e199429deffb85025cd35d0cfd4fe2ec9fe237cf66482f6de6b14cd6ef23`.

The GUI's **Resolver + Plan** stage is successful, not a failure: E1 receipt is `PASS_E1_PREPARATION_ONLY`; GUI/CLI semantic parity is `PASS`; D9.10 bridge planning is `PASS_BRIDGE_PLANNING_ONLY`; D composition plan is valid with real GAME-visible editorial; the request is `visual_drills / tracking / tier-1`, gameplay seed `12345`, music seed `840001`, `REVIEW_720`. This remains deliberately plan-only at E1 and does not claim renderer or dispatch activation. The second GUI action, the shared D A/V executor, fails before the native C11-C producer starts.

Exact failure from `logs/c11c_drill_producer.log`: C11-C's `run_visual_drill_production.ps1` rejects `-SpeedMultiplier` because it receives `75000`, outside `[ValidateRange(0.1,3.0)]`. The pinned profile `profiles/difficulty/visual_drill_tracking.json` has tier 1 `speed_multiplier=0.75` (source SHA-256 `6de8812bd46904e122ecdd0eae22fb2979bd75399c34779248c6569e833c921e`). The adapter applied Python's host decimal separator and sent `0,75000`. On the operator's locale, Windows PowerShell 5.1 parameter binding split/coerced that comma decimal and delivered `75000`. This is a cross-locale numeric argument-boundary defect in the D adapter, not a defect in the pinned C11-C launcher or difficulty profile.

The failure occurs before a successful C11-C capture. There is no native MP4, no D frame composition, no FAMILY_MUSIC_V4 WAV generation, no mux, and no final FFprobe result in this run. The failure does not indicate an editorial, font, Qt, geometry, phase/timebase, music determinism, or A/V stream-equivalence defect. The first evidence bundle contains `RUNNING` and `FAILURE` receipts and the exact native producer log. The `-tests.zip` is a preparation/parity/contract receipt bundle; it does not show a second independent A/V failure. Do not infer additional failures from its intentionally plan-only receipts.

**V1.4 correction:** remove host-locale formatting entirely. Python emits an ASCII invariant string such as `0.75000` to a string-typed PowerShell wrapper. The wrapper parses it with `[System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::InvariantCulture`, sets the wrapper thread culture to invariant for the call, then invokes the existing pinned C11-C launcher with an already-typed `[double]$speed`. The native C11-C launcher remains byte-identical and receives `0.75`; C11-C stays silent via `-NoSound`. The wrapper is retained in the run logs and its hash/argument are written into the execution receipt. Regression tests cover invariant formatting, wrapper parse/type handoff, and absence of host-locale formatting. The V1.4 installer additionally executes this exact wrapper against a dummy parameter-compatible launcher while forcing `es-ES`, and requires the dummy to record `0.75` before any repository mutation.

The failed output root `artifacts/production/c11e/D99-GUI-85201B7B4FF7` is intentionally preserved. It must not be overwritten. The retry must use a **new unique request_id/output root** (generate a fresh GUI request and repeat Resolver + Plan); do not delete or recycle this failed evidence. After V1.4 installation PASS: audit its postimages/source pins, rerun the GUI plan stage with a fresh ID, then execute only `tracking/tier-1`. Continue only when native capture, D composition, FAMILY_MUSIC_V4 A/B/C, final A/C video/audio stream hashes, FFprobe, and human visual/listening review pass. CLI smoke/parity follows on the same shared adapter. Do not start the 20-selector A/V matrix until the single-selector result is accepted.

Governance is unchanged: E1 `PREPARE_ONLY`; `family_adapter.status=NOT_CONNECTED_E1`; `production_dispatch=false`; `release_authority=NONE`; no Git checks; commits operator-managed; C11-C frozen manifest SHA remains `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`.

# ROADMAP OVERRIDE — E4C EXECUTION ADAPTER — 2026-11-11

E4C current state: Binder V2, 20 native silent source captures and real-frame pixel qualification 100/100 are accepted. The next implementation is one D-owned execution adapter behind the existing GUI and existing E1 CLI. First qualify one `tracking/tier-1` A/V request; expand to all 20 only after that route is accepted. E1 remains PREPARE_ONLY; C11-C remains production authority.

After full E4C closure: E5 cross-family determinism, separate gameplay/music domains, profile/binder non-leakage and GUI/CLI parity; E6 Smoke18 (six full A/V cases per family); E7 Matrix101 (54 Challenge +27 Loop +20 Drill, with CH_008/009 held pending phase-sum authority, 99 provisional runnable); E8 row-by-row historical C-to-E regression, independent acceptance, freeze and separately authorized promotion/cutover.

No stage in this roadmap itself changes renderer/dispatch/release authority.

---

## V9 current state — 2026-11-11

Consumer V8 stopped in `STAGED_VALIDATION` before any repository transaction. The exact cause was a StrictMode ordering bug in the installer: `$testSource` was inspected for the removed `QT_VERSION_STR` token before it was assigned from the staged test file. The run's journal is empty and `rollback=NOT_NEEDED`; no rollback or repository recovery is required. V9 fixes this by loading both `$consumerSource` and `$testSource` first, validating both are non-empty, and only then inspecting their contents. This is an installer-only correction. The Qt consumer, 35-test module and E1 service replacement bytes are unchanged from V8.

V9 also corrects the run ID and receipt/failure schema identities to V9. It preserves the 18-operation scope (one exact-pinned E1 service REPLACE + 17 D-owned ADDs), all 13 support pins, 10 design/font pins, exact-hash operator decisions, frozen C11-C manifest and no-new-dependency policy. The installer uses the existing canonical Producer Python/PySide6 only; it must not invoke pip, install/uninstall packages, change requirements or mutate shared environment dependencies.

V9 is a candidate only. Windows PowerShell 5.1 AST, Qt runtime probe, py_compile 3/3, tests 35/35, immediate pre-transaction rechecks and successful receipt are still pending. No consumer V1–V8 transaction has been recorded. Stop at first failure; do not repeat A.3 V5, binder V2, Godot V3, Loop22 or historical authoring accepted gates.

Next step: verify V9 ZIP SHA and sidecar, then run the V9 installer with the existing canonical `-PythonExe`. Require the same 18 destination states and all pre-write gates. After PASS, inspect `INSTALL_RECEIPT.json`, its SHA and all 18 postimages before any E1 integration review. C11-C remains sole production authority; renderer OFF; dispatch/media/audio OFF; `release_authority=NONE`.

---

## E4C current subgate status — Consumer V7 guide correction (2026-11-11)

## V8 current state — 2026-11-11

V7 failed closed in `STAGED_VALIDATION` before transaction. Its installer imported `QT_VERSION_STR` from `PySide6.QtCore`; the canonical PySide6 runtime does not export that symbol. This is an installer probe defect, not evidence that PySide6, Qt, QImage or QPainter is missing. The preceding imports of `PySide6.__version__` succeeded. `journal=[]`; `rollback=NOT_NEEDED`; no checkout write occurred.

V8 changes the probe to `from PySide6.QtCore import qVersion` and records `qVersion()` as the Qt runtime version. It requires Qt 6.x, alongside Python 3.13.x, existing PySide6 6.8–6.x, non-null RGB888 QImage and active QPainter. The official Qt for Python API lists `qVersion()` as a QtCore function. V8 does not install, upgrade or uninstall packages, invoke pip, edit requirements, or mutate the shared Python environment.

The consumer, its 35 Qt tests and the E1 service replacement are byte-identical to V7. No functional test result is inferred from the failed V7 runtime probe. V8 must still pass Windows PowerShell 5.1 AST, inventory/pins/destinations/staging, runtime probe, `py_compile` 3/3, all 35 Qt tests and immediate pre-transaction checks before any write. Do not repeat accepted A.3, binder V2, Godot V3, Loop22 or historical Drill authoring.

Governance remains unchanged: C11-C frozen manifest SHA `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`; renderer OFF; dispatch/media/audio OFF; `release_authority=NONE`; operator manages commits; Git checks skipped.

### Roadmap position
E4C remains open at the Drill visual consumer qualification gate. After V8 installs and passes real Qt tests, continue to Producer GUI/CLI observation, real C11-C Drill frames, family-native `FAMILY_MUSIC_V4` A/V qualification, FFmpeg/FFprobe and human review. Then E5 → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 (99 provisional; CH_008/009 held) → E8 independent historical regression and separate promotion.

---


The E4C Drill consumer remains in its isolated visual-consumer install gate. V6 failed closed before transaction solely because the staged runner guide V15 omitted the exact `No new Python dependency` anchor, while retaining a historical Pillow section that conflicted with its current Qt-only policy. V7 supplies guide V16 and reconciles the current policy. No dependency installation or environment mutation is part of the roadmap. After V7 passes Windows staged validation and installs, verify live Qt Producer output, all 20 selectors, fonts/pixels and GUI/CLI parity; only then continue native Drill A/V, E4C closure and E5 → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 → E8. Renderer, dispatch/media and release remain blocked.

## E4C current subgate status — 2026-11-11 (supersedes V5 Pillow path)

The Drill visual consumer is not installed. V1/V2/V4 all failed closed before transaction; V4 reached runtime preflight and found no `PIL` module. The V5 proposal to install Pillow in the shared Producer interpreter was an error and is superseded. V6 changes the D-owned consumer renderer to the existing PySide6/Qt already required by Producer; no new Python dependency, package installation, global environment mutation or C11-C requirements edit. The Qt implementation's full 35-test Windows qualification is mandatory before installation. After E4C consumer/Qt/pixel/A/V human gates close, continue E5 → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 (99 provisional; CH_008/009 held) → E8 independent historical regression/freeze/separate promotion.

## E4C current subgate status — 2026-11-11

The Drill visual consumer is not installed. V4's installer reached Python runtime validation and failed solely because the canonical Python 3.13.14 interpreter has no Pillow module. V5 records `Pillow==12.3.0` as a D-owned dependency and requires operator-managed installation/RAQM verification before its Windows install. After E4C consumer/Qt/pixel/A/V human gates close, continue E5 → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 (99 provisional; CH_008/009 held) → E8 independent historical regression/freeze/separate promotion.

# C11-D → C11-E Full-Family Roadmap — V71 (2026-11-11)

## Target product

One C11-E service produces validated audiovisual outputs for Challenge, Visual Loop and Visual Drill, using D presentation/layout/editorial, family-correct music, FFmpeg mux/FFprobe QA, immutable receipts and the existing Producer GUI/CLI adapters over the same E1 service. C11-C mechanics, generators, timelines, binders and core audio remain immutable until E8 and a separate cutover decision.

## Accepted family evidence — do not repeat absent source drift

- E4A accepted in its recorded scope.
- E4B Loop22 CLOSED/operator-approved: 44/44 A/V, 22/22 A/B, 25/25 tests and human visual/audio approval.
- Historical Drill authoring 20/20 on 24 source pins.
- E4C binder V2 active Windows PASS: 20/20 selectors/repeats/request manifests/lineage and 67/67 pins; receipt `31f631c3c23c6c1d277d67f52dd887010ee51be869798ab8db3fbdec8658fa01`.
- E4C Godot console V3 smoke PASS; receipt `526c7d360863af8fb53707c9c83162173f4c1f1eb349ee8d767fb97665167a31`.
- A.3 Drill design-contract V5 CLOSED/PASS active Windows; receipt `d39eec2b3c1d969a3cb0d4e6aaa14b87aadcba74e42e58d283e00ea50768e881`; do not repeat.

## Ordered work remaining

1. Install and qualify Consumer V4 in active Windows. V1 and V2 failed closed pre-transaction; V3 was superseded before Windows use after the faithful V121 staging replay exposed missing read-only roots. V4 includes the complete test dependency roots and local reconstructed replay passed py_compile 3/3 + tests 35/35; Windows AST/runtime/receipt remain open.
2. Review receipt, E1 service diff/postimage and all 17 D-owned additions. Inspect the single shared E1 boundary; preserve existing GUI/CLI route and parity. No second Producer, binder or suite module.
3. Observe actual Qt Producer runtime with protected C11-C source frames over all 20 Drill selectors; review phase visibility, native PRE_ROLL/END_CTA ownership, fonts/shaping/glyph coverage, clipping/overflow/contrast and source/pixel identity.
4. Qualify native Drill A/V only under separate applicable authority: silent protected C11-C capture, existing `FAMILY_MUSIC_V4` (`tracking=FLOWING_VECTOR`, `pursuit=ORGANIC_BLOOM`, `saccade=CIRCUIT_PULSE`, `peripheral_scan=ORBITAL_RITUAL`), separate gameplay/music seeds, FFmpeg/FFprobe and human listening/visual review. D.1 is not audio-generation authority.
5. Close E4C only after the consumer/pixel gate, actual GUI/CLI and Qt evidence, native family A/V and operator human review all pass.
6. E5: cross-family determinism, gameplay/music seed isolation, profile/binder non-leakage, negative controls and GUI/CLI parity.
7. E6 Smoke18: six complete A/V cases per family, 18 total, with immutable receipts and operator visual/listening review.
8. E7 Matrix101: 54 Challenge +27 Loop +20 Drill target. CH_008/CH_009 stay held until authority resolves the 11s declared vs 12s phase-sum discrepancy; 99 provisional runnable cases.
9. E8: row-by-row historical C11-C to E regression map, independent acceptance, immutable freeze and separate explicit promotion/cutover.

## Exact Drill approvals and scope

Operator decision record `C11E_E4C_DRILL_COMPOSITION_OPERATOR_DECISION_RECORD_20261110_V1.json` SHA `eb95da188065b8ebcb2371e2a6bcff6762ce000a5ca74f8ea384ecec4ee58303` approves geometry SHA `b22f9eb6fce39f877e432ff5f0051ecf5ab8575ecb9f580fe5f158994222fc09` and timebase SHA `44ab3b0fa09a6f7d42cd8cf2f1122cada6cbffe16a7a6b53c2af5e88d5daddc8` as proposed, limited to D-owned design/contract and isolated pixel tests. Native phases remain PRE_ROLL 3s → GAME → END_CTA 3s → DONE; D editorial is GAME-only; native source-frame/header/footer and END_CTA CTA are preserved.

## Immutable governance

Frozen C11-C 2.19.12 manifest remains 796,318 bytes / `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`. No protected mechanics, generators, binders, timelines, RNG, simulation truth or core audio changes. No sixth module/second Producer/parallel binder. `GIT_CHECKS=SKIPPED; COMMITS=OPERATOR_MANAGED; SOURCE_FILE_PINS=ENFORCED`. Renderer OFF, dispatch/media false, D4.8 BLOCKED, D9.10 PREPARE_ONLY, D9.14/16 BLOCKED, D9.17 BLOCKED_NO_GO, D10 BLOCKED_FOR_PROMOTION, `release_authority=NONE`.


## Current 2026-11-12 E4C status
GUI A/V `tracking/tier-1` is accepted as row 1/20. V1.5 CLI smoke installer failed closed before transaction; V1.6 add-only correction is next. After installation PASS, qualify the CLI A/V entrypoint with a fresh request ID, then run the remaining 19 selectors. Do not repeat accepted GUI pilot, 20 native silent captures or 100/100 pixel gate. E4C closes only after CLI smoke + 20/20 matrix + required human review.


## 2026-11-12 sequencing correction

E4C is still the current active phase. CLI A/V smoke has now technically passed, but the user's visual review rejected the V1 spatial composition. Close this defect using the D-owned V2 social-body consumer and existing-media requalification; do not start the remaining A/V matrix until V2 tracking/tier-1 output is operator-accepted. Then complete remaining 19 selectors and formal E4C closeout.

After E4C: E5 determinism/gameplay-vs-music seed isolation/profile-binder non-leakage/GUI-CLI parity → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 (CH_008/009 held; 99 provisional) → E8 historical C-to-E regression, independent acceptance, immutable freeze and separately authorized promotion. C11-C remains sole production authority throughout.


## Authoritative update — V1.9 geometry contract test failure / V2.0 consolidated correction (2026-11-12)

The operator ran V1.9. Package SHA, 26/26 inventory, 21/21 support pins, frozen C11-C manifest and PowerShell AST 2/2 all passed. The installer then failed closed in `STAGING_AND_PYTHON_TESTS`, before transaction initialization or destination writes, because the staged consumer rejected `geometry.canvas` as a social-region mismatch; 0 tests ran. The installer created its failure diagnostic under the designated `artifacts/tests/c11e/e4c_v2_installer` evidence root; no source/destination operation was applied and the transaction journal remained empty.

Root cause is exact and localized in the V2 contract oracle. The V2 proposal's `geometry.canvas` contains five fields: `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and `aspect_ratio="9:16"`. Both `_verify_decision_and_proposals()` and `validate_plan()` compared it by exact dictionary equality against a four-field expectation that omitted `aspect_ratio`. The proposal is correct; the validator expectation was incomplete. It was duplicated in two independent validation sites, so both must use the same single canonical region constant.

V2.0 consolidates the correction: one `EXPECTED_SOCIAL_REGIONS` constant includes the exact 9:16 metadata and is used by proposal and plan validation; the frozen 540x960 logical `PresentationProfile.get_social_regions()` is checked against the exact 4/3 projection to 720x1280, yielding header 720x192, body 720x896 at y=192, and footer 720x192 at y=1088. Two tests are added: reject tampered aspect-ratio metadata and prove the logical-to-REVIEW_720 projection. Focused suite rises from 18 to 20 tests. No proposal, decision, timebase, C11-C, E1, GUI/CLI, execution adapter, music, binder, requalifier or runner behavior is changed.

V1.9 must not be rerun. V2.0 is a rebuilt overlay candidate; its Windows PySide6/Qt OFFSCREEN tests and transaction remain unqualified until the operator-run installer produces the complete receipt. No further installer iteration is authorized by this package record absent a new independent failure with evidence.

## V2.1 authoritative reconciliation (2026-11-12)

`E4C_OPEN_V2_REQUALIFICATION_PENDING`. Geometry V2 and the Test 04 boundary correction are accepted: `validate_plan()` now requires `source_frame_viewport == EXPECTED_SOCIAL_REGIONS["body_rect"]`. Reconciled consumer SHA-256: `e5cf97651e546ad86e2a4d46698553038e4161dc97a55da2654f197ed71f623c` (36,678 bytes); unchanged test SHA-256: `62327e32ed4c15b497efb4a93fecc1d484cebff0b79beaa7ced5099905ffb2bf`; isolated Python 3.13.14 evidence is py_compile PASS and 20/20 PASS.

V1.7 destination preflight, V1.8 operation/package binding, V1.9 geometry contract and V2.0 staging Test 04 failures are closed before transaction; none installed this correction. V2.1 is rebuilt and pending Windows installation, complete receipt and postimage review. Do not install V2.0 and do not repeat GUI, CLI smoke, native capture, music or Binder.

Preserve evidence GUI `D99-GUI-6514F1066E79`, CLI `E4C-CLI-SMOKE-20261112T091253Z-5a2e96b8`, native silent MP4, WAV A/B/C, seeds and bitstreams. V1 composition was visually rejected; `tracking/tier-1` is not yet an accepted V2 matrix row.

Required sequence: documentation; V2.1 installation; receipt/postimage audit; one existing-media requalification; seven-image/three-MP4 review; operator visual/audio acceptance; row 1/20; remaining 19; E4C close; E5, E6 Smoke18, E7 Matrix101, E8. C11-C 2.19.12 only; frozen manifest `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`; E1 `PREPARE_ONLY / NOT_CONNECTED_E1`; no Git, pip, C11-C mutation, dispatch or release; operator-managed commits.
