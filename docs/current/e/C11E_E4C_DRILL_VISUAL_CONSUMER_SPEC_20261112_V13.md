# C11-E E4C V2.2 PIN-ALIGNMENT R1 — CURRENT AUTHORITATIVE STATE (2026-11-13)

**This block supersedes all earlier E4C V2 installer instructions below.** Older V1.7–V2.2 incidents remain historical evidence; do not rerun superseded packages.

## Visual consumer contract and approval-pin authority

- The V2 design/consumer/test contract remains accepted in isolated qualification. Consumer SHA-256 `e5cf97651e546ad86e2a4d46698553038e4161dc97a55da2654f197ed71f623c` (36,678 bytes); unchanged test SHA-256 `62327e32ed4c15b497efb4a93fecc1d484cebff0b79beaa7ced5099905ffb2bf` (12,263 bytes); Python 3.13.14 compilation and the Qt-offscreen suite previously passed 20/20.
- The approved operator decision record is an immutable, content-pinned approval input: `docs/current/e/C11E_E4C_DRILL_COMPOSITION_OPERATOR_DECISION_RECORD_20261112_V2.json`, 2,925 bytes, SHA-256 `bceef9a22c27447ccbef5487339c25626e4cb4c5d32509809b832411655914e8`. The consumer constant `DECISION_SHA` is exactly this value. Do not edit or append execution state to this record. Put mutable execution state in the Authority, Gates, Backlog, Execution Plan, Incident Register and continuity prompts.
- The first reviewed package `ecfe23aca3de0474c717d03b1d719195612d754f8a5cd14b039fa1179cc1b3bf` was defective because its documentation update appended `latest_execution_state` to that pinned decision record, changing its SHA to `5d77eb624b0f14079a41a83776b5f6cbf7883cc55361f407d5cf5b34ea21c242`. This was correctly rejected by the staged consumer before tests or transaction. Do not use or rerun that ZIP.
- Operator installation attempt `C11E_E4C_DRILL_V2_V2_2_20261113T061938Z_c33b887a` failed closed at `STAGING_AND_PYTHON_TESTS`: `approved V2 design/source pin mismatch` for the decision record. Diagnostic: `artifacts/tests/c11e/e4c_v2_installer/C11E_E4C_DRILL_V2_V2_2_20261113T061938Z_c33b887a/INSTALL_FAILURE.json`. Transaction journal was empty (`[]`), rollback errors were empty, and the failure explicitly reports `FAIL_CLOSED_PRE_TRANSACTION_NO_DESTINATION_WRITES`. No replacement/addition destination was written; no C11-C source was changed; no dispatch or release authority was granted.
- The independent Windows path-specific preflight `C11E_E4C_DRILL_V2_V2_2_20261113T061924Z_7c2e5422` passed: path lengths 139/213/256/195 (evidence root/forward backup/rollback backup/max operation temp), Win32 limit 259; forward and rollback `File.Replace` PASS; probe cleanup PASS. It detected the old V2.1 temp sibling as `FOUND_EXPECTED_POSTIMAGE_PRESERVED`; that file was verified against the accepted consumer postimage and deliberately left untouched. Do not delete it.
- Corrective action: restore the decision record byte-for-byte from the approved V2.2 source (`bceef9a22c27447ccbef5487339c25626e4cb4c5d32509809b832411655914e8`), retain the consumer/test/installer payloads unchanged, and keep operational state exclusively in mutable documentation. No functional consumer, test, installer, or source-pin change is authorized by this correction.

## Corrected package and next action

Use **`C11E_E4C_DRILL_VISUAL_COMPOSITION_V2_REQUALIFICATION_V2_2_PIN_ALIGNED_R1_20261113.zip`** and its adjacent `.sha256` sidecar only. Extract to the new directory `C11E_E4C_DRILL_VISUAL_COMPOSITION_V2_REQUALIFICATION_V2_2_PIN_ALIGNED_R1_20261113` in Downloads; never extract over the active checkout. The installer remains `22f097f672fffcc855e0080ed590bffc8fbe6b3142f3ca57bb270ec2f1883414`. Package shape remains one exact consumer replacement + 24 ADD_ONLY additions, 21 source pins, 27 package files, and the unchanged 20-test suite.

The separate path-specific `File.Replace` probe has already passed against the exact V2.2 installer/path strategy. This pin-alignment correction changes only the decision-record payload and documentation/manifest hashes; it does not alter the installer or any destination path. Do not rerun the standalone probe. The installer itself still performs its own staged checks and its built-in forward/rollback `File.Replace` preflight before any transaction write.

1. Verify the new ZIP using its sidecar, extract to the new package directory, and run the V2.2 installer once with `-PackageZip` set to this exact ZIP.
2. Require package inventory 27/27, source pins 21/21, frozen C11-C manifest PASS, PowerShell AST 2/2, 1 REPLACE + 24 ADD_ONLY, Python runtime/PySide6/Qt-offscreen PASS, py_compile 3/3, staged tests 20/20, built-in File.Replace preflight PASS, immediate recheck PASS, and final `PASS_REPLACE_AND_ADD_ONLY_INSTALL`.
3. On any failure, stop and preserve the full `INSTALL_FAILURE.json`, transaction journal and console output. Do not repeat the installer blindly. Since this failure was pre-transaction, no rollback/recovery work is needed.
4. After install success, audit the receipt, journal, 25 destination postimages and 21 unchanged source pins. Only then run the existing-media V2 A/V requalification once.
5. Do not repeat the accepted GUI/CLI smoke, native captures, music generation, E4B Loop22, Binder or pixel qualifications. Reuse the preserved CLI native MP4 and WAV A/B/C.

## E4C gate state and forward roadmap

- V2 isolated consumer/tests: **PASS**.
- V2.2 path-specific forward/rollback `File.Replace`: **PASS**.
- V2.2 Windows installation: **BLOCKED / NOT INSTALLED** by the pinned decision-record mismatch in the superseded ZIP; corrected pin-alignment R1 candidate prepared, Windows execution pending.
- Existing-media A/V V2 requalification: **NOT RUN / PENDING INSTALL PASS**.
- V2 operator visual/audio acceptance: **PENDING**; `tracking/tier-1` remains 0/20 V2 rows.
- After V2 acceptance, run remaining 19 selectors, close E4C at 20/20, then E5 → E6 Smoke18 → E7 Matrix101 (CH_008/009 held; 99 provisional) → E8 historical C-to-E regression, independent acceptance, immutable freeze and separately authorized promotion.

## Permanent governance

Active checkout `C:\Users\vinxe\Projects\ChallengeEngineV01_STATELESS` is sole source authority. `GIT_CHECKS=SKIPPED`; `COMMITS=OPERATOR_MANAGED`; no pip or shared dependency changes. C11-C 2.19.12 remains sole production authority; frozen manifest SHA-256 `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`. E1 `PREPARE_ONLY`; `family_adapter.status=NOT_CONNECTED_E1`; no C11-C mutation, no production dispatch, `release_authority=NONE`.

# C11-E E4C Drill visual consumer specification — V13 (2026-11-12)


## Authoritative installer correction — V1.8 package-binding failure / V1.9 consolidated recovery (2026-11-12)

The operator's V1.8 run passed the ZIP sidecar and entered the package installer, then failed closed at `OPERATION_PACKAGE_FILE_BINDING_FAIL` for `docs/current/e/C11D_E_BLOCKER_REMEDIATION_REGISTER_20261112_V54.md`. The V1.8 builder renamed physical documentation payloads to the next versioned filenames (for example V55) but failed to regenerate the matching `replacements`/`additions` destination rows; several operation destinations still referenced their predecessor names. The validator correctly rejected the mismatch before the transaction journal or destination writes. This was a package-manifest construction defect, not a Windows runtime issue. Do not rerun V1.8.

V1.9 is a complete rebuilt overlay. Its operation rows are generated directly from the physical payload tree: `payload/replace/<relative>` maps only to `REPLACE <relative>`, and `payload/add/<relative>` maps only to `ADD_ONLY <relative>`. The installer independently enforces that mapping for every operation, verifies one-to-one closure between all payload files and operation rows, rejects duplicate package paths and destination paths, and checks manifest counters against actual arrays. The V1.9 matrix is exactly one existing D-consumer replacement plus 23 add-only destinations (24 mutation operations); package inventory also includes the README and installer. All versioned current-doc and prompt destinations now match their package paths exactly.

V1.9 preserves the V2 consumer, 18 focused tests, requalifier, runner, 21 support pins and 91-pin/CLI source evidence unchanged. The only changes from V1.8 are installer/manifest construction integrity, corrected operation destinations, documentation/prompt version increments, and incident recording. The V1.8 attempt failed before transaction; no checkout destination mutation occurred. V1.9 remains `NOT_YET_INSTALLED` pending its Windows 5.1/Python 3.13/PySide6 preflight and transaction receipt.

The V1.9 installer also reports pre-transaction failures distinctly as `FAIL_CLOSED_PRE_TRANSACTION_NO_DESTINATION_WRITES` with a `%TEMP%` diagnostic, rather than labelling an empty journal as a completed rollback. No Git, pip, shared dependency, GUI/CLI, E1, C11-C, dispatch or release changes are permitted.



## Authoritative update — V1.7 installer incident and V1.8 correction (2026-11-12)

V1.7 failed closed at `DESTINATION_PREFLIGHT` because it misclassified the newly introduced `tests/test_c11e_e4c_drill_visual_composition_consumer.py` as a replacement. The destination was absent in the active checkout. The declared preimage SHA `aedeb5754d94fdbaad134a653f57ca07466c845dcef081c8774668245455a7a0` is actually the historical V9 test stored under `tools/c11d/d9/`, not a preimage at the new `tests/` path. This is a manifest/installer classification defect, not a V2 consumer failure. The failure occurred before evidence-root and transaction-journal initialization; no destination writes or repository mutations occurred. Its generic `FAIL_CLOSED_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` message reflects a zero-entry/no-op rollback.

V1.8 supersedes V1.7 and is the only candidate permitted for installation. Its operation matrix is exactly one hash-guarded replacement (`tools/c11d/d9/c11e_e4c_drill_visual_composition_consumer.py`) plus 22 `ADD_ONLY` destinations, including the new test module. The installer asserts the exact classification, unique operation destinations, and uses manifest-resolved package paths for staged inputs. It rechecks all source pins and all destination states before journaling/writing. Do not rerun V1.7. No source, GUI/CLI, E1 service, executor, C11-C or shared dependency changes are included.

V1.8 install status: `NOT_YET_INSTALLED`. Do not claim V2 Windows qualification from package/static checks. After install PASS, reuse the already accepted CLI native MP4 and WAV A/B/C for the existing-media V2 requalification; no new C11-C capture or music generation. E4C remains open, V2 A/V acceptance pending operator review, matrix not started. C11-C remains sole production authority; E1 PREPARE_ONLY / NOT_CONNECTED_E1; dispatch false; release authority NONE.

## Purpose

Define D-owned consumption of the unchanged C11-C Visual Drill frame stream in `REVIEW_720`. This version supersedes V9 only for the consumer's spatial composition and phase ownership. It does not alter C11-C output or its source.

## Authoritative geometry

Use `core/presentation/PresentationProfile.gd::get_social_regions()` with the exact source pin SHA-256 `187b1cf8ab96b9031785a0f36b0054a60383c97cb3d81906c7d9bbcd373bef24` (8,837 bytes). `get_composition_geometry()` is a safe-area compatibility geometry and is not the Drill body viewport.

At 720×1280, the canonical full-width regions are:

| Region | Rectangle | Ownership |
|---|---:|---|
| Header | `(0,0,720,192)` | D editorial title/subtitle during GAME only |
| Body | `(0,192,720,896)` | Exact native C11-C social-body pixels during GAME |
| Footer | `(0,1088,720,192)` | D editorial CTA during GAME only |

Source logical social canvas is 540×960, header/body/footer ratios 0.15/0.70/0.15; device scale is 4/3.

## Phase ownership

- PRE_ROLL: return the complete native C11-C frame, unchanged; no D bands, no D text.
- GAME: allocate 720×1280 D canvas; copy only source rectangle `(0,192,720,896)` to the identical destination rectangle; no scale, interpolation, resampling, stretch, or translation. Draw D title and subtitle in header and CTA in footer. Native family header/footer must not enter the GAME body.
- END_CTA: return the complete native C11-C frame unchanged; native C11-C CTA/header remains authoritative; no D overlay.
- DONE: no delivery frame.

## Timebase

The already approved V1 timebase proposal remains immutable: 90 PRE_ROLL + 630 GAME + 90 END_CTA = 810 frames at 30fps (27s). Frame order and indices remain identity; no resampling.

## Pixel invariants

1. For every GAME frame, RGB888 source crop bytes at `(0,192,720,896)` equal destination body bytes at the same coordinates.
2. For every PRE_ROLL and END_CTA frame, complete RGB888 output bytes equal source frame bytes.
3. Source QImage is not mutated.
4. D editorial is visible only in GAME; fields remain title/subtitle/call_to_action and raw source editorial/hash are unchanged.
5. Font coverage and layout overflow fail closed; no truncation or unsupported glyph substitution.
6. The test oracle must explicitly reject V1 centered contain viewport `(108,192,504,896)`.

## Execution boundary

Only D-owned consumer and test replacement. Existing E1 service, GUI, CLI facade, D shared A/V executor, C11-C sources, launchers, binders, music and dependencies remain unchanged. Existing-media isolated requalification may use the preserved CLI native MP4 and existing WAV A/B/C; do not invoke Godot, C11-C launcher, new native capture or music generation. E1 remains PREPARE_ONLY / NOT_CONNECTED_E1, production dispatch false, release NONE.


## Authoritative update — V1.9 geometry contract test failure / V2.0 consolidated correction (2026-11-12)

The operator ran V1.9. Package SHA, 26/26 inventory, 21/21 support pins, frozen C11-C manifest and PowerShell AST 2/2 all passed. The installer then failed closed in `STAGING_AND_PYTHON_TESTS`, before transaction initialization or destination writes, because the staged consumer rejected `geometry.canvas` as a social-region mismatch; 0 tests ran. The installer created its failure diagnostic under the designated `artifacts/tests/c11e/e4c_v2_installer` evidence root; no source/destination operation was applied and the transaction journal remained empty.

Root cause is exact and localized in the V2 contract oracle. The V2 proposal's `geometry.canvas` contains five fields: `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and `aspect_ratio="9:16"`. Both `_verify_decision_and_proposals()` and `validate_plan()` compared it by exact dictionary equality against a four-field expectation that omitted `aspect_ratio`. The proposal is correct; the validator expectation was incomplete. It was duplicated in two independent validation sites, so both must use the same single canonical region constant.

V2.0 consolidates the correction: one `EXPECTED_SOCIAL_REGIONS` constant includes the exact 9:16 metadata and is used by proposal and plan validation; the frozen 540x960 logical `PresentationProfile.get_social_regions()` is checked against the exact 4/3 projection to 720x1280, yielding header 720x192, body 720x896 at y=192, and footer 720x192 at y=1088. Two tests are added: reject tampered aspect-ratio metadata and prove the logical-to-REVIEW_720 projection. Focused suite rises from 18 to 20 tests. No proposal, decision, timebase, C11-C, E1, GUI/CLI, execution adapter, music, binder, requalifier or runner behavior is changed.

V1.9 must not be rerun. V2.0 is a rebuilt overlay candidate; its Windows PySide6/Qt OFFSCREEN tests and transaction remain unqualified until the operator-run installer produces the complete receipt. No further installer iteration is authorized by this package record absent a new independent failure with evidence.

## V2.1 authoritative reconciliation (2026-11-12)

`E4C_OPEN_V2_REQUALIFICATION_PENDING`. Geometry V2 and the Test 04 boundary correction are accepted: `validate_plan()` now requires `source_frame_viewport == EXPECTED_SOCIAL_REGIONS["body_rect"]`. Reconciled consumer SHA-256: `e5cf97651e546ad86e2a4d46698553038e4161dc97a55da2654f197ed71f623c` (36,678 bytes); unchanged test SHA-256: `62327e32ed4c15b497efb4a93fecc1d484cebff0b79beaa7ced5099905ffb2bf`; isolated Python 3.13.14 evidence is py_compile PASS and 20/20 PASS.

V1.7 destination preflight, V1.8 operation/package binding, V1.9 geometry contract and V2.0 staging Test 04 failures are closed before transaction; none installed this correction. V2.1 is rebuilt and pending Windows installation, complete receipt and postimage review. Do not install V2.0 and do not repeat GUI, CLI smoke, native capture, music or Binder.

Preserve evidence GUI `D99-GUI-6514F1066E79`, CLI `E4C-CLI-SMOKE-20261112T091253Z-5a2e96b8`, native silent MP4, WAV A/B/C, seeds and bitstreams. V1 composition was visually rejected; `tracking/tier-1` is not yet an accepted V2 matrix row.

Required sequence: documentation; V2.1 installation; receipt/postimage audit; one existing-media requalification; seven-image/three-MP4 review; operator visual/audio acceptance; row 1/20; remaining 19; E4C close; E5, E6 Smoke18, E7 Matrix101, E8. C11-C 2.19.12 only; frozen manifest `e405d08e4d166b1ad95953558f4a088e73eea9527e6e89244beb4096eac4b953`; E1 `PREPARE_ONLY / NOT_CONNECTED_E1`; no Git, pip, C11-C mutation, dispatch or release; operator-managed commits.
